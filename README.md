# Image Classifier Project


## Description
  This app allows the user to train a neural network to learn differnt plant
  types using pictures of them.
  The app will then abe able to fed a picture a one of the trained flowers and
  predict which flower it is.

## Installation
  Part 1: Training neural network.

    $ git clone https://github.com/dgMello/image_classifer_nd.

    Open command prompt.

    Navigate to where repository is.

    Enter into command prompt with arguments below: $ python train.py.

    --data_dir: Location of data directory where pictures used to train network
    are located. Required

    --save_dir: Where checkpoint will be save. Will default to current directory
    is no argument is provided.

    --arch: Must choose 'alexnet' or 'vgg16'.

    -- -learning_rate: Learnrate used to train network. Defaults to 0.0001
    if no argument is provided.

    --hidden_units: Number of hidden unit layers in network. Defaults to
    2509 if no argument is provided.

    --epochs: Number of epochs used to train network. Defaults to 3 if no
    argument is provided.

    --gpu: If entered GPU will be used to train network. Defaults to False
    if no argument is provided.

Part 2: Predicting with trained neural network

    Enter into command prompt with arguments below: $ python predict.py.

    input: Filepath of picture that will be inputed into the neural network.
    Required.

    checkpoint: Filepath of checkpoint file that will be load neural network.

    --top_k: Number of classes neural network will provide a prediction. Defaults
    to 5 if no argument is provided.

    --category_names: File that contains categories mapping. Defaults to
    cat_to_name.json if no argument is provided.

    --gpu: If entered GPU will be used to do prediction. Defaults to False
    if no argument is provided.
